# String Concatenation Benchmark `Umar Asghar`

This repository contains a simple Java program to benchmark string concatenation using the "+" operator and `StringBuilder` class. It measures the time taken to concatenate a large number of strings using both methods and provides a comparison of their performance.

## Usage

To run the benchmark test, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
https://github.com/umrasghar/StringConcatenationBenchmark.git
3. Navigate to the project directory:
cd src/com/umr
4. Compile the Java file:
javac StringConcatenationBenchmark.java
5. Run the benchmark:
java StringConcatenationBenchmark


You should see the output with the time taken for concatenation using the "+" operator and `StringBuilder` printed in milliseconds.



Feel free to modify the code or adjust the number of iterations to suit your requirements. Experiment with different scenarios to observe the performance difference between string concatenation methods.
